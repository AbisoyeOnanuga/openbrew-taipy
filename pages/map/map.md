The brewery type map displays various types of breweries across the United States. Each marker represents a specific type of brewery:

- **Micro**: Most craft breweries. For example, Samual Adams is still considered a microbrewery.
- **Nano**: An extremely small brewery which typically only distributes locally.
- **Regional**: A regional location of an expanded brewery (e.g., Sierra Nevada’s Asheville, NC location).
- **Brewpub**: A beer-focused restaurant or restaurant/bar with a brewery on-premise.
- **Large**: A very large brewery (likely not for visitors, e.g., Miller-Coors).
- **Planning**: A brewery in planning or not yet opened to the public.
- **Bar**: A bar with no brewery equipment on premise (deprecated).
- **Contract**: A brewery that uses another brewery’s equipment.
- **Proprietor**: Similar to contract brewing but refers more to a brewery incubator.
- **Closed**: A location which has been closed.
